## Amazon's 14 Leadership Principles

### 1. Customer Obsession
Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

- **Customer is always right**

  - Time I worked on a landing page where the user picked the certificate to use to login to the page and one day when I went to VA and talked to our customer he mentioned they get 
frustated about always forgetting which of the two certs he had to choose. When I came back I went to the person in charge of authentication and asked him to check how many
failed attempts to connect to the website we had. And they were about 30% of the total logins. Since there wasn't a way to show the user only one cert, I came up with the solution 
of showing a pop up before choosing the cert stating which cert had to be chosen. After that the fail attempts to login fail dramatically to 2%
  - Time when human factor person came with a design that didn't fully satisfy the user 
- **Questions**
  - Walk us through a time when you helped a customer through a difficult process and what that looked like.
  - When you’re working with a large number of customers, it’s tricky to deliver excellent service to them all. How do you go about prioritizing your customers’ needs?
  - Give me an example of a time when you did not meet a client’s expectation. What happened, and how did you attempt to rectify the situation?
  - Who was your most difficult customer?
  - Tell the story of the last time you had to apologize to someone.
  - Can you tell me about a time you obsessed over giving very high quality service to a customer?

###  2. Ownership
Leaders are owners. They think long term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say "that's not my job"

- **The whole project you work on is "yours"**

  - Situation when I was busy and asked my coworker for help and he didn't do it
  - We have a ticketing system to see what was hapenning When telework started the users were not able to access our application via vpn. Never say that's not my job. Your product is your baby
- **Questions**
  -  Give me a example of when you took a risk and it failed.
  - Tell me about a time when you had to make a difficult short term decision to make long term gains.
  - Tell me about a time when you had to work on a project with unclear responsibilities.
  - Tell me about a time when you had to leave a task unfinished.
  - Tell me about a time when you took on a task that went beyond your normal responsibilities.
  - Tell me about a time when you took it upon yourself to work on a challenging initiative.

###  3. Invent and Simplify

Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by "not invented here." As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

- **It's always better to have ideas that to don't have anything. Simple is always better**

  - Time when I pointed out my PM I felt our project was just a middleman
  - Time when I created a logs management solution that was necessary to operate in production
- **Questions**
  - Tell me a time when you created an innovative product.
  - Tell me about a time when you failed to simplify a process and what you would have done differently.
  - Tell me about a time when you innovated on something and it went wrong.
  - Tell me about a time when you changed a process at work through either an innovative new way or simplification.
  - Tell me about a time when you invented something.
  - Tell me about a time when you gave a simple solution to a complex problem.

### 4. Are Right, A Lot
Leaders are right a lot. They have strong business judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

- **Assess each decision with reasons and listen to all opinions**

  - Presented a new solution using aws for our system instead of agnostic services
  - Time when I changed the way we do documentation
- **Questions**
  - Tell me about a time when you observed two business opportunities to improve ROI, and how did you determine that they were connected.
  - Tell me about a time when you had to work with incomplete data or information.
  - Tell me about a time when you were wrong.
  - Tell me about a time when you had to use your judgment to solve a problem.
  - Tell me about a time when you incorporated a diverse set of perspectives into solving a problem.
  - Tell me about a time when you had your beliefs challenged and how you responded.

### 5. Learn and Be Curious
Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

- **Always learn new things and be able to adapt**

  - Presented tech talk about blockchain to my division
  - Time when I learned how to make games
- **Questions**
  - How do you find the time to stay inspired, acquire new knowledge, innovate in your work?

  - Tell me about an experience you went through that changed your way of thinking.
  - Tell me about a time when your curiosity helped you make a smarter decision.
  - Tell me about the most important lesson you learned in the past year.

### 6. Hire and Develop the Best
Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

- **Help other grow/learn**

  - How I've helped 5 people come onboard on the team (create account, websites they need, useful links, goals)
  - Time when I taught an np what to look on a project and decide his best fit
- **Questions**
  - Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a poor performer on your team.
  - Tell me about a time when you made a wrong hire. When did you figure it out and what did you do?
  - Tell me about a time when you mentored someone.
  - Tell me about the best hire your ever made.
  - What qualities do you look for most when hiring others?
  - Who is the most important person in your life and why?

### 7. Insist on the Highest Standards
Leaders have relentlessly high standards—many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and driving their teams to deliver high-quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

- **Always improve. Never be satisfied. Never be done**

  - Example of something that was working but came with and optimal way even if solution was harder
- **Questions**
  - Tell me about a time when you could have stopped working but persisted.
  - Tell me about a time when a team member didn’t meet your expectations on a project.

  - Tell me about a time when you raised the bar.
  - Tell me about a time when you motivated a team to go above and beyond.
  - Tell me about a time when you were dissatisfied with the quality of something at work and went out of your way to improve it.

### 8. Think Big
Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

- **Any idea is possible**

  - Example of thinking of something too impossible. A logistics system based on blockchain
- **Questions**
  - Tell me about a time when you proposed a new business.
  - Tell me about a time when you went way beyond the scope of the project and delivered.

  - Tell me about a time when your vision resulted in a big impact.
  - Tell me about a time when you had to make a bold and difficult decision.

### 9. Bias for Action
Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.

- **Taking action is better than not doing anything**

  - Our application was down and the protocol is that the technical support comes in to see where it failed and fixes it. Meanwhile, I created a stack of instances with the latest backup of the system and put it online
- **Questions**
  - Describe how you would handle a busy situation where three people are waiting for help from you.
  - Tell me about a time when you took a calculated risk.
  - Tell me about a time you needed to get information from someone who wasn’t very responsive. What did you do?
  - Describe a time when you saw some problem and took the initiative to correct it rather than waiting for someone else to do it.
  - Tell me about a time when you had to make a decision with little data or information.
  - Tell me about a time when you made a decision too quickly and what you would have done differently.

### 10. Frugality
Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.

- **Accomplish more with less. Never be done and always have a lot of work**
  - Presented talk to CIO and was working on 2 other projects and working with my dad afterwork
- **Questions**

  - Tell me about a time when you beat out the competition with less resources.
  - Tell me about a time when you had to be frugal.

### 11. Earn Trust
Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

- **Dont be an asshole and have values. Assume your fault if something doesn't work**
  - Story about worst mistake I made. Deleting the wrong stack and how assume the blame and solve the problem

  - What is the quality you value least about yourself?
  - What do you do to gain the trust of your teammates?
  - Tell me about a time you had to speak up in a difficult environment.

### 12. Dive Deep
Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

- **Get deep into the system and don't accept just because it was the "normal"**
  - Story about how contractor coded toapgi and went through two layers of teams and the one in charge of the installation did it manually. It annoyed me that the process could be simplified by adding it to the CFT and I learned how to install the application and created a CFT out of it to create the instances and install the application within the same pipeline
  - Time when I collaborated on a research paper
- **Questions**

  - Tell me about the most complex problem you’ve ever worked on.
  - Tell me about a time when understanding the details of a situation helped you arrive to a solution.
  - Tell me about a time you utilized in depth data to come across a solution.


### 13. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

- **Data based disagreements are great**

  - Tell me about an unpopular decision of yours.
  - What do you believe that no one else does?

### 14. Deliver Results
Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle. 

- **It's ok to not have the perfect product on launch date, but it is necessary to launch a mvp**
